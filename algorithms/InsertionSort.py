# Insertion sort involves finding the right place for a given element in a sorted list
# So in beginning we compare the first two elements and sort them by comparing them.
# Then we pick the third element and find its proper position among the previous two sorted elements.
# This way we gradually go on adding more elements to the already sorted list by putting them in their proper position.

## Time Complexity
# Insertion Sort is an easy-to-implement, stable sorting algorithm with 
# time complexity of O(nÂ²) in the average and worst case, and O(n) in the best case. 
# For very small n, Insertion Sort is faster than more efficient algorithms such as Quicksort or Merge Sort.
