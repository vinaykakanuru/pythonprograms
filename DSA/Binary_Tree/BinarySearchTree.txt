Binary Search Tree is a Binary tree which statisfies the below conditions:
a) For any given node it has atmost (0/1/2) child nodes
b) For any given Node Left sub-tree elements are always smaller values
c) For any given Node Right sub-tree elements are always greater values
d) In-order traversal of BST will be always a sorted array

If we want to delete an element/node from BST there could be 3 situations:
a) Deleting node may not have any child nodes (simply delete the node)
b) Deleting node may have 1 child node (replace the deleted node with its child node irrespective of left/right side)
c) Deleting node may have 2 child nodes (here we can replace the value in two ways)
    i) In-order predecessor (Maximum of Left sub-tree of deleted node)
    ii) In-order Successor (Minimum of Right sub-tree of deleted node)
